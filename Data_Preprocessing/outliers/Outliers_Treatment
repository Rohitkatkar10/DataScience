Most of the datasets have extreme values or exceptions in their observations. 
These values affect the predictions (Accuracy) of the model in one way or the other, removing these values is not a very good option.
For these types of scenarios, we have various techniques to treat such values. 

1.	Prepare the dataset by performing the preprocessing techniques, to treat the outliers.
