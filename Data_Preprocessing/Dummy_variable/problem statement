Data is one of the most important assets. It is often common that data is stored in distinct systems with different formats and forms.
Non-numeric form of data makes it tricky while developing mathematical equations for prediction models.
We have the preprocessing techniques to make the data convert to numeric form. Explore the various techniques to have reliable uniform standard data.




1)	Prepare the dataset by performing the preprocessing techniques, to have the all the features in numeric format.
