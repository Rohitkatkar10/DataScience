Problem statement:
Data collected may have duplicate entries, that might be because the data collected were not at regular intervals or any other reason. To build a proper solution on such data will be a tough ask. The common techniques are either removing duplicates completely or substitute those values with a logical data. There are various techniques to treat these types of problems.

Q1. For the given dataset perform the type casting (convert the datatypes, ex. float to int)
Q2. Check for the duplicate values, and handle the duplicate values (ex. drop)
Q3. Do the data analysis (EDA)?
Such as histogram, boxplot, scatterplot etc
