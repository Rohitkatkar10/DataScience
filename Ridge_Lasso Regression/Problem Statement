Problem Statements:
1.	Officeworks is a leading retail store in Australia, with numerous outlets around the country. 
The manager would like to improve the customer experience by providing them online predictive
prices for their laptops if they want to sell them. To improve this experience the manager would 
like us to build a model which is sustainable and accurate enough. Apply Lasso and Ridge Regression
model on the dataset and predict the price, given other attributes. Tabulate R squared, RMSE, and 
correlation values.


 


2.	An online car sales platform would like to improve its customer base and their experience by 
providing them an easy way to buy and sell cars. For this, they would like to have an automated
model which can predict the price of the car once the user inputs the required factors. Help the 
business achieve the objective by applying Lasso and Ridge Regression on it. Please use the below 
columns for the analysis: Price, Age_08_04, KM, HP, cc, Doors, Gears, Quarterly_Tax, Weight.

	 

3.	Data of various countries and the factors affecting their life expectancy has been recorded 
over the past few decades. An analytics firm would like to know how it varies country wise and
what factors are influential. Use your skills to analyze the data and build a Lasso and Ridge 
Regression model and summarize the output. Snapshot of the dataset is given below.
