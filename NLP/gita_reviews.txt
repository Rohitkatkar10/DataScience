From the day I started Reading holy book, I first buy from Amazon a Bhagavad Gita Book. It‚Äôs because I love it. I love to be with the words of the supreme personality.First, I want to derive the meaning of Bhagavad Gita for you...Bhagavad means Divine & Gita means poetry/Song...Hence you can say it is a divine song that Lord Yogeshwar has uttered for the well being of all creatures in this universe.When Arjuna faces confusions during the Mahabharata War, It‚Äôs Lord who delivers him this supreme knowledge.Lord shows how the life of every being is like a battle through Mahabharata war.For a moment just place yourself in the state of Arjuna and see what you see‚Ä¶Lust, Greed, Ignorance and all darkness within you as your friends‚Ä¶You get confused about how to destroy them... You search everywhere to enlighten your self and reach to Ishwara( Parambrahman) as Arjuna sees everywhere his own brothers and family. He is confused about how to win the war‚Ä¶Here Lord comes and shows the path of divinity and leads him to win the war.Lord says in Gita ‚Äú It is the most mysterious knowledge that I am expounding here. It is simple yet sovereign. Every creature can practice it. It is the king of all sciences around‚ÄùHe tells about Karma(action), jnana( knowledge), Adhyatma(spirituality), Atman(soul) and Paramatman(supreme soul).He shows the importance of action and sacrifice. He reveals the mystery of death and birth and tells how one can attain the supreme goal. He describes Yoga in various ways and suggests all beings to ponder upon it.Hence the essence of Gita is Life. It is not a book but the force of life that governs all. Though it is printed on paper, yet this force is there for those who love Ishwara and want to see him in all creatures, beings, and non-beings.Those that read Bhagavad Gita without understanding that Krishna is God, will have a beautiful temple that is empty. You may still marvel at the architecture, and appreciate the intricate marble work and wood carvings; you may feel the tranquillity and enjoy the peacefulness; experience a sense of awe and inspiration seeing the beautiful craftsmanship and the devotion in the artwork, but without a Deity present there for whom all the work has been done, then it‚Äôs just a beautiful but empty building.Don‚Äôt appreciate Bhagavad Gita as a beautiful, inspiring, but empty building, appreciate it as being the house and Song of God.\n\n', '\n\n  Fantastic purchase... N really its a new edition of Bhagavad Gita\n\n', "\n\n  Hare krsnaI have seen many people saying this book claims that women are inferior.I myself a vaishya  (businessman)and in some photos he has shown photos that women businessman and sudras (workers who work for gratifying the senses)cannot understand Vedas buy by the grace of the Lord we can understand his science by reading gita and bhagvatam. There is practical reason behind this. We business man don't have time to read 4 Vedas and that to under a guru if you are a businessman you will know.And women also didn't have time to read it in vedic age because they were housemakers they had to make food decorate the house recieve the guests help and care the child and gratify their husbands.They also had a busy schedule. And the sudras or workers(people who work not for the highest goal which is supreme lord but to gratify their sense)if you have worked in a office being completely not indulged in spiritual activities you will know you don't have time to read Vedas .Thus all these false allegations are clarified. But how can we understand geet let me tell you if you read the only 10 pages per day you will finish it in 80 days excluding the introduction and outro sanskrit shlokas and their relationship of who is whose relative and other stuff which is given in the last pages not that important you can do it that 10 page per day don't take a lot of time .But for Vedas you need guru and where will you get nice guru in kaliyug .And geeta also we read under guru but the purports in this book are there to guide us like a guru who is shrila Prabhupad.Stop spreading false propaganda against Srila Prabhupad and iskcon. And regarding page 657 or 656 the purport is slightly misleading but it can be solved very easily. Just like we man have role in the society women in vedic times were the housemakers they decorate stuff. Make food gratify their husbands take care of their children and give them sanskar. They are bound to not do something but we all have roles and they perform that role you are creating inferiority complex because people now say that mom who are housemakers are dihati or backward but the mother who goes to office has not time for cooking and caring their child .But we don't see that and that in turn will lead to behavioural issues in child which no one speaks of and also stays I office whole day when will they give time to their child? And regarding one more pic where material nature of energy of Lord is called inferior let me explain. The base tattva of this God science is acityabhedabhed means continously different and etc not different. Iskcon is a gaudiya vaishnav community whose main deity is radha not krsna although it might seem so krsna is .They worship krnsa because radha loves him. And yes she is considered which you will know when you join iskcon and go there and ask .And let me give and please like I have muscular energy or calories in my body I control it right but without it will I function if I don't have enough calories in my body or simply energy derived from food. So as it applies in God krsna's main potency is ahladinni and other are incomplete yet they are given full respect and yet they are inferior to hladinni who is radha. Material nature is maya and it given equal respect but yet it is inferior and we belong to higher energy called hladinni or radha we are her parts and parcels and since krsna idol non different than radha so we are his parts and parcels. As I mentioned about acityabhedabhed she is given respect and yet she is lower energy. Read krsna the supreme personality of godhead it is the book from the same author there in energy section of Krsna the writer himself says both energies are given equal respect. If it's given don't have muscular energy will I move no and muscular energy is there but I am bot there so it can't function nature also can't function automatically it is controlled. If you draw a life like rose you have to invest a lot of intellect and time. So how can you conclude the universe is independent and it created itself some scientists also not believe in big bang theory now they allure ng new theory . Similarly my wife cannot give birth to child until my sperm goes inside is not independent in that way in same way the material nature is dependent on lord for creation. And it's inferior energy because it is not complete manifeatatiom of Lord's energy but hladinni is superior because she is compete manifestation of Lord's energy not half. Don't be fool analyse the situation then react. The Lord complete energy is nothing without him and the Lord is nothing without his complete energy.\n\n", "\n\n  I went with this as it was the bestseller amongst all the Gitas available but later found out that this one is highly biased and have some sexist comments too.

From the day I started Reading holy book, I first buy from Amazon a Bhagavad Gita Book. It‚Äôs because I love it. I love to be with the words of the supreme personality.First, I want to derive the meaning of Bhagavad Gita for you...Bhagavad means Divine & Gita means poetry/Song...Hence you can say it is a divine song that Lord Yogeshwar has uttered for the well being of all creatures in this universe.When Arjuna faces confusions during the Mahabharata War, It‚Äôs Lord who delivers him this supreme knowledge.Lord shows how the life of every being is like a battle through Mahabharata war.For a moment just place yourself in the state of Arjuna and see what you see‚Ä¶Lust, Greed, Ignorance and all darkness within you as your friends‚Ä¶You get confused about how to destroy them... You search everywhere to enlighten your self and reach to Ishwara( Parambrahman) as Arjuna sees everywhere his own brothers and family. He is confused about how to win the war‚Ä¶Here Lord comes and shows the path of divinity and leads him to win the war.Lord says in Gita ‚Äú It is the most mysterious knowledge that I am expounding here. It is simple yet sovereign. Every creature can practice it. It is the king of all sciences around‚ÄùHe tells about Karma(action), jnana( knowledge), Adhyatma(spirituality), Atman(soul) and Paramatman(supreme soul).He shows the importance of action and sacrifice. He reveals the mystery of death and birth and tells how one can attain the supreme goal. He describes Yoga in various ways and suggests all beings to ponder upon it.Hence the essence of Gita is Life. It is not a book but the force of life that governs all. Though it is printed on paper, yet this force is there for those who love Ishwara and want to see him in all creatures, beings, and non-beings.Those that read Bhagavad Gita without understanding that Krishna is God, will have a beautiful temple that is empty. You may still marvel at the architecture, and appreciate the intricate marble work and wood carvings; you may feel the tranquillity and enjoy the peacefulness; experience a sense of awe and inspiration seeing the beautiful craftsmanship and the devotion in the artwork, but without a Deity present there for whom all the work has been done, then it‚Äôs just a beautiful but empty building.Don‚Äôt appreciate Bhagavad Gita as a beautiful, inspiring, but empty building, appreciate it as being the house and Song of God.\n\n', '\n\n  Fantastic purchase... N really its a new edition of Bhagavad Gita\n\n', "\n\n  Hare krsnaI have seen many people saying this book claims that women are inferior.I myself a vaishya  (businessman)and in some photos he has shown photos that women businessman and sudras (workers who work for gratifying the senses)cannot understand Vedas buy by the grace of the Lord we can understand his science by reading gita and bhagvatam. There is practical reason behind this. We business man don't have time to read 4 Vedas and that to under a guru if you are a businessman you will know.And women also didn't have time to read it in vedic age because they were housemakers they had to make food decorate the house recieve the guests help and care the child and gratify their husbands.They also had a busy schedule. And the sudras or workers(people who work not for the highest goal which is supreme lord but to gratify their sense)if you have worked in a office being completely not indulged in spiritual activities you will know you don't have time to read Vedas .Thus all these false allegations are clarified. But how can we understand geet let me tell you if you read the only 10 pages per day you will finish it in 80 days excluding the introduction and outro sanskrit shlokas and their relationship of who is whose relative and other stuff which is given in the last pages not that important you can do it that 10 page per day don't take a lot of time .But for Vedas you need guru and where will you get nice guru in kaliyug .And geeta also we read under guru but the purports in this book are there to guide us like a guru who is shrila Prabhupad.Stop spreading false propaganda against Srila Prabhupad and iskcon. And regarding page 657 or 656 the purport is slightly misleading but it can be solved very easily. Just like we man have role in the society women in vedic times were the housemakers they decorate stuff. Make food gratify their husbands take care of their children and give them sanskar. They are bound to not do something but we all have roles and they perform that role you are creating inferiority complex because people now say that mom who are housemakers are dihati or backward but the mother who goes to office has not time for cooking and caring their child .But we don't see that and that in turn will lead to behavioural issues in child which no one speaks of and also stays I office whole day when will they give time to their child? And regarding one more pic where material nature of energy of Lord is called inferior let me explain. The base tattva of this God science is acityabhedabhed means continously different and etc not different. Iskcon is a gaudiya vaishnav community whose main deity is radha not krsna although it might seem so krsna is .They worship krnsa because radha loves him. And yes she is considered which you will know when you join iskcon and go there and ask .And let me give and please like I have muscular energy or calories in my body I control it right but without it will I function if I don't have enough calories in my body or simply energy derived from food. So as it applies in God krsna's main potency is ahladinni and other are incomplete yet they are given full respect and yet they are inferior to hladinni who is radha. Material nature is maya and it given equal respect but yet it is inferior and we belong to higher energy called hladinni or radha we are her parts and parcels and since krsna idol non different than radha so we are his parts and parcels. As I mentioned about acityabhedabhed she is given respect and yet she is lower energy. Read krsna the supreme personality of godhead it is the book from the same author there in energy section of Krsna the writer himself says both energies are given equal respect. If it's given don't have muscular energy will I move no and muscular energy is there but I am bot there so it can't function nature also can't function automatically it is controlled. If you draw a life like rose you have to invest a lot of intellect and time. So how can you conclude the universe is independent and it created itself some scientists also not believe in big bang theory now they allure ng new theory . Similarly my wife cannot give birth to child until my sperm goes inside is not independent in that way in same way the material nature is dependent on lord for creation. And it's inferior energy because it is not complete manifeatatiom of Lord's energy but hladinni is superior because she is compete manifestation of Lord's energy not half. Don't be fool analyse the situation then react. The Lord complete energy is nothing without him and the Lord is nothing without his complete energy.\n\n", "\n\n  I went with this as it was the bestseller amongst all the Gitas available but later found out that this one is highly biased and have some sexist comments too.

N really its a new edition of Bhagavad Gita\n\n', "\n\n  Hare krsnaI have seen many people saying this book claims that women are inferior.I myself a vaishya  (businessman)and in some photos he has shown photos that women businessman and sudras (workers who work for gratifying the senses)cannot understand Vedas buy by the grace of the Lord we can understand his science by reading gita and bhagvatam. There is practical reason behind this. We business man don't have time to read 4 Vedas and that to under a guru if you are a businessman you will know.And women also didn't have time to read it in vedic age because they were housemakers they had to make food decorate the house recieve the guests help and care the child and gratify their husbands.They also had a busy schedule. And the sudras or workers(people who work not for the highest goal which is supreme lord but to gratify their sense)if you have worked in a office being completely not indulged in spiritual activities you will know you don't have time to read Vedas .Thus all these false allegations are clarified. But how can we understand geet let me tell you if you read the only 10 pages per day you will finish it in 80 days excluding the introduction and outro sanskrit shlokas and their relationship of who is whose relative and other stuff which is given in the last pages not that important you can do it that 10 page per day don't take a lot of time .But for Vedas you need guru and where will you get nice guru in kaliyug .And geeta also we read under guru but the purports in this book are there to guide us like a guru who is shrila Prabhupad.Stop spreading false propaganda against Srila Prabhupad and iskcon. And regarding page 657 or 656 the purport is slightly misleading but it can be solved very easily. Just like we man have role in the society women in vedic times were the housemakers they decorate stuff. Make food gratify their husbands take care of their children and give them sanskar. They are bound to not do something but we all have roles and they perform that role you are creating inferiority complex because people now say that mom who are housemakers are dihati or backward but the mother who goes to office has not time for cooking and caring their child .But we don't see that and that in turn will lead to behavioural issues in child which no one speaks of and also stays I office whole day when will they give time to their child? And regarding one more pic where material nature of energy of Lord is called inferior let me explain. The base tattva of this God science is acityabhedabhed means continously different and etc not different. Iskcon is a gaudiya vaishnav community whose main deity is radha not krsna although it might seem so krsna is .They worship krnsa because radha loves him. And yes she is considered which you will know when you join iskcon and go there and ask .And let me give and please like I have muscular energy or calories in my body I control it right but without it will I function if I don't have enough calories in my body or simply energy derived from food. So as it applies in God krsna's main potency is ahladinni and other are incomplete yet they are given full respect and yet they are inferior to hladinni who is radha. Material nature is maya and it given equal respect but yet it is inferior and we belong to higher energy called hladinni or radha we are her parts and parcels and since krsna idol non different than radha so we are his parts and parcels. As I mentioned about acityabhedabhed she is given respect and yet she is lower energy. Read krsna the supreme personality of godhead it is the book from the same author there in energy section of Krsna the writer himself says both energies are given equal respect. If it's given don't have muscular energy will I move no and muscular energy is there but I am bot there so it can't function nature also can't function automatically it is controlled. If you draw a life like rose you have to invest a lot of intellect and time. So how can you conclude the universe is independent and it created itself some scientists also not believe in big bang theory now they allure ng new theory . Similarly my wife cannot give birth to child until my sperm goes inside is not independent in that way in same way the material nature is dependent on lord for creation. And it's inferior energy because it is not complete manifeatatiom of Lord's energy but hladinni is superior because she is compete manifestation of Lord's energy not half. Don't be fool analyse the situation then react. The Lord complete energy is nothing without him and the Lord is nothing without his complete energy.\n\n", "\n\n  I went with this as it was the bestseller amongst all the Gitas available but later found out that this one is highly biased and have some sexist comments too.

The base tattva of this God science is acityabhedabhed means continously different and etc not different. Iskcon is a gaudiya vaishnav community whose main deity is radha not krsna although it might seem so krsna is .They worship krnsa because radha loves him. And yes she is considered which you will know when you join iskcon and go there and ask .And let me give and please like I have muscular energy or calories in my body I control it right but without it will I function if I don't have enough calories in my body or simply energy derived from food. So as it applies in God krsna's main potency is ahladinni and other are incomplete yet they are given full respect and yet they are inferior to hladinni who is radha. Material nature is maya and it given equal respect but yet it is inferior and we belong to higher energy called hladinni or radha we are her parts and parcels and since krsna idol non different than radha so we are his parts and parcels. As I mentioned about acityabhedabhed she is given respect and yet she is lower energy. Read krsna the supreme personality of godhead it is the book from the same author there in energy section of Krsna the writer himself says both energies are given equal respect. If it's given don't have muscular energy will I move no and muscular energy is there but I am bot there so it can't function nature also can't function automatically it is controlled. If you draw a life like rose you have to invest a lot of intellect and time. So how can you conclude the universe is independent and it created itself some scientists also not believe in big bang theory now they allure ng new theory . Similarly my wife cannot give birth to child until my sperm goes inside is not independent in that way in same way the material nature is dependent on lord for creation. And it's inferior energy because it is not complete manifeatatiom of Lord's energy but hladinni is superior because she is compete manifestation of Lord's energy not half. Don't be fool analyse the situation then react. The Lord complete energy is nothing without him and the Lord is nothing without his complete energy.\n\n"]
